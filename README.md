# FarmConnect
FarmConnect is a final year B.Tech project developed to address the critical challenges faced by small and marginal farmers in accessing agricultural machinery and skilled labour. In India, where nearly 80% of farmers are smallholders and only 18% are digitally literate, traditional booking methods are inefficient, time-consuming.
